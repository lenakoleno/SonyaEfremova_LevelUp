You hurt where you sleep
And you sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and
now you're gonna cry
You got a woman to the left
and a boy to the right
Start to sweat so hold me tight

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again
